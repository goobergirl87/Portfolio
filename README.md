# Portfolio

My first version of a portfolio, that I actually like. It will be added constantly not only by new projects, but also by new skills I'm learning. So far the responsiveness ist basically non existent. But that's definitely a topic, I'll keep on working.

Originally this repository was called Debbojangles, but to be more professional, I changed it to portfolio. Lame, I know. But Debbo is still there, just look at the file names.

It feels awesome to use all the new skills not only in the projects from TOP but also on this portfolio page, which feels like my personal playground. If you want to get in contact with me, visit my page and go find me :)
